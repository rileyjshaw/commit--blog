### Local setup

 1. Clone this repo
 2. Pip install `dev-requirements.txt` (hopefully in a virtualenv)
 3. Edit your OS `hosts` file (at `/etc/hosts`). I know, this sucks.
 4. Register an application at GitHub
 5. Set the redirect urls to your localhost setup
 6. Set up environment variables (virtualenvwrapper's postactivate hook is sweet)
